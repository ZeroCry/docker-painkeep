PainKeep QuakeWorld setup
-------------------------

This document is intended for those who wish to run PainKeep on their QuakeWorld
servers. If you are just installing to play as a client, make a directory beneath 
your Quake directory called PainKeep (it MUST be called PainKeep on both the
client AND the server).  Start the QuakeWorld client as you normally 
would and when you log into a PainKeep QuakeWorld server, the server will transmit 
the gamedir and play will begin.  (even easier than regular Quake...)


Server info:

1.  You must have installed PainKeep 1.1 to run PainKeep QuakeWorld.  If 
	you have not installed PainKeep, go download the latest version
	from http://www.planetquake.com/skins/painkeep/

2.  Change to the directory where you installed PainKeep 1.1 and unzip the
	contents of this ZIP file into that directory.

3. Load the autoexec.cfg file for regular Quake, or the server.cfg for
    QuakeWorld in the PainKeep directory into your favorite text
    editor.  The default one looks something like this:

        deathmatch 1
        hostname "PainKeep 1.1"
        fraglimit 30
        noexit 1
	temp 384	

    Detailed description follows:

        hostname "PainKeep"
            This is the hostname of your Quake server that people see when
            they query it.  I recommend you use something that identifies it
            uniquely as your server.  It is best to leave PK or PainKeep in 
            the title so people know your server is running PainKeep. (this also
            makes it easier for those with custom QSpy tabs to find you)

        timelimit 30
            If no one gets to the fraglimit in 35 minutes, change levels
            anyway.

        fraglimit 30
            Change levels when someone gets to 30 frags.

        noexit 1
            Don't allow exiting from the level


	temp1 387  (for QuakeWorld servers use: 'serverinfo options' and not 'temp1')

	The server setup for our configuration variables is all run from the "temp1" variable.

	It sets 4 values:
	1.	Hub level time-out.
			The hub level time-out now has a maximum time setting of 63.
	2.	SFX disabled/enabled.
			0 = enabled
			64 = disabled
	3.	Duty checking disabled/enabled.
			0 = disabled
			128 = enabled
	4.	Default status display on/off for connecting players. 
		(the one that displays fraglimit & timelimit, after the player connects he can 
		personally turn it off/on him/herself)
			0 = disabled
			256 = enabled

	
	Now to set the temp1 you just add up all the options.
	EG. if you wanted a 3 min hub time-out with sfx enabled, duty checking on,
	& default status on you would
	temp1 = 3 + 0 + 128 + 256
	temp1 = 387
	(or "serverinfo options = 387" for QuakeWorld servers)

4. Run the server.
